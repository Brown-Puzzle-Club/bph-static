**Status**: We finished writing the hunt within 24 hours! If you want to solve the puzzles, you can [register a team here](https://puzzlethon.brownpuzzle.club/).

If you enjoyed this hunt, and want to support Brown Puzzle Club, consider [donating to our club](https://bbis.advancement.brown.edu/BBPhenix/give-now?did=05732af4-d994-4d40-bcd6-fb42d07b6eab). Proceeds go directly toward events like this (mostly the server costs). 

### What is this?

Puzzlethon is an event where we write, test, and publish an entire puzzlehunt in 24 hours. 

It's light-hearted, low-stakes, and a great way to get into writing puzzles if you're a Brown/RISD student.

We'll also be livestreaming the event. If you're curious about taking a look behind the scenes to see what goes into writing a puzzlehunt, check it out!

Making a puzzlehunt requires all kinds of people with many different skillsets: we need <span class="bold-text">writers</span>, <span class="bold-text">programmers</span>, <span class="bold-text">artists</span>, <span class="bold-text">testers</span>, and more. If you're interested in participating in Puzzlethon (and you're a Brown or RISD student), fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/sWsfF7gDDDtHwPKi7)! 


### What's a puzzlehunt?

A puzzlehunt is an event where teams of people compete to solve puzzles. These puzzles can be anything: word games, logic puzzles, video games, physical objects, or in-person challenges.

For a (much larger) example, take a look at last year's <a href="https://www.brownpuzzlehunt.com">Brown Puzzlehunt</a>.

### When is it?

Writing will start on November 23rd, at noon ET.

Puzzles will be released on November 24th, at noon ET.
